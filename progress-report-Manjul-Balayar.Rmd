```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(Lahman)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Loading the Hall of Fame dataset from Lahman package to check its structure.
data("HallOfFame", package = "Lahman")
head(HallOfFame)
```

## Web Scraping Verification

```{r}
# Scrape the webpage and check the structure of the tables.
url_2023 <- "https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_2023.shtml"
web_page <- read_html(url_2023)
hof_tables <- html_table(web_page, fill = TRUE)
# Display the structure of all scraped tables to identify which one we need.
str(hof_tables)
# Show the first few rows of the first table to ensure it's correct.
head(hof_tables[[1]])
```

## Data Cleaning and Setup

```{r}
# Assuming the first table is correct, let's clean and set up columns.
hof_2023_raw <- hof_tables[[1]]
names(hof_2023_raw) <- as.character(hof_2023_raw[1,])
hof_2023 <- hof_2023_raw[-1, ]
names(hof_2023) <- names(hof_2023) %>% trimws()
# Convert names to a standardized lowercase format to avoid case sensitivity issues.
names(hof_2023) <- tolower(names(hof_2023))
# Verify the structure after renaming.
str(hof_2023)
```

## Handling Duplicate Column Names

```{r}
# Check current names and identify duplicates
print(names(hof_2023))

# Renaming duplicate columns by appending a prefix based on their order or context (e.g., batting or pitching)
names(hof_2023) <- make.unique(names(hof_2023), sep = "_")

# Alternatively, you can manually rename to be more descriptive, especially for critical columns like 'g', 'h', 'hr', 'bb':
names(hof_2023)[which(names(hof_2023) == "g")] <- c("games_batting", "games_pitching")
names(hof_2023)[which(names(hof_2023) == "h")] <- c("hits_batting", "hits_pitching")
names(hof_2023)[which(names(hof_2023) == "hr")] <- c("home_runs_batting", "home_runs_pitching")
names(hof_2023)[which(names(hof_2023) == "bb")] <- c("walks_batting", "walks_pitching")

# Verify the changes
print(names(hof_2023))
```

## Data Transformation

```{r}
# Constants for vote calculations
total_ballots_2023 <- 389
votes_needed_2023 <- 292  # Calculated based on some criteria like 75% of total ballots

# Transform data, ensuring column names now match the unique ones assigned
hof_2023_transformed <- hof_2023 %>% 
  mutate(
    playerid = gsub("X-", "", tolower(name)),  # Adjust based on the column 'name'
    yearid = 2023,
    votedby = "BBWAA",
    ballots = total_ballots_2023,
    needed = votes_needed_2023,
    votes = as.integer(votes),
    inducted = ifelse(votes >= votes_needed_2023, "Y", "N"),
    category = "Player",  # Assuming all entries are for players
    needed_note = NA_character_
  )

# Verify the transformed data
head(hof_2023_transformed)
```

```{r}
hof_2023_transformed <- hof_2023_transformed %>%
  select(playerID = playerid, yearID = yearid, votedBy = votedby,
         ballots, needed, votes, inducted, category, needed_note)

# Convert the 'inducted' column from character to factor to match the Lahman 'HallOfFame' dataset
hof_2023_transformed$inducted <- factor(hof_2023_transformed$inducted, levels = c("N", "Y"))

# Verify the structure again
str(hof_2023_transformed)

```

## Data Integration and Export

```{r}
# Combine with existing Hall of Fame data.
combined_hof <- rbind(HallOfFame, hof_2023_transformed)
# Export to CSV.
write_csv(combined_hof, "HallOfFame2023.csv")
```
